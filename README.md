# NLP-Projects

Welcome to my **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** repo — a growing collection of projects where I explore how machines can understand, process, and respond to human language.  
Each project here dives into a different NLP concept — from sentiment analysis to chatbots, text classification, and beyond.
